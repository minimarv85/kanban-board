## KEY MARKET INSIGHTS FROM 2026

### 1. "Vibe Coding" Epidemic Killing App Quality
> "90% of posts get removed because new accounts with 0 karma try to post. Most of these are low quality, low effort, vibe coded clones."
> — r/MacApps Mod Team

**OPPORTUNITY:** Quality, handcrafted apps are RARE now. Build something with actual thought and you'll stand out immediately.

### 2. Subscription Fatigue is REAL
> "People will pay $49 once for a desktop app that solves their problem, works offline, no recurring fees"
> — @heygeorgekal

**OPPORTUNITY:** One-time purchases (£4.99-£14.99) are making a huge comeback. Users are DONE with subscriptions.

### 3. Simplicity Wins Over Features
> "I removed features instead of adding them — and users finally stuck"
> — Pocket Clear creator

**OPPORTUNITY:** Micro-apps with ONE job done perfectly beat complex apps every time.

### 4. UK Market Specifically Underserved
From r/smallbusiness and r/UKBusiness analysis:
- UK tradespeople (2M+) have NO good mobile tools
- UK small business owners overwhelmed by complex enterprise tools
- UK freelancers struggling with simple invoicing/expense tracking
- Local UK services (lawn care, cleaning, pet sitting) have NO apps
