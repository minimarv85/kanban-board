## Conversation Summary

assistant: The local file still has the duplicate! Let me fix it properly:

assistant: Now let me deploy the fixed version:

assistant: Fixed! Now let me push to GitHub:

assistant: **Fixed and deployed!** ✅

The issue was duplicate JavaScript functions causing errors. Now there's only ONE of each function.

**Try it now:**
https://main.tradetax.pages.dev

All buttons should work:
- Navigation between screens ✓
- Add Income/Expense ✓  
- Tax Calculator ✓
- Mileage Tracker ✓
- VAT Calculator ✓
- Invoice Generator ✓
- Reports & Export ✓

The JavaScript was throwing errors before because of the duplicate functions. Now it's clean and should work properly.
