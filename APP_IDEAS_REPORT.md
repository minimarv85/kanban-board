## KEY INSIGHTS FROM RESEARCH

### 1. Subscription Fatigue is Real
> "People will pay $49 once for a desktop app that: solves their problem, works offline, no recurring fees"
> — @heygeorgekal on X

**Opportunity:** One-time purchase apps are making a comeback. Users hate subscriptions.

### 2. Simplicity Wins
> "I removed features instead of adding them — and users finally stuck"
> — Pocket Clear creator on r/AppIdeas

**Lesson:** Micro-apps with ONE job done perfectly outperform feature-rich apps.

### 3. Niche Community Gaps
- "I wish there was an app JUST for gamedev news and discussions" — @IsaiahToth_Dev
- Async Magic: The Gathering (like async chess) — @UncWorldwide

### 4. Local/Community Discovery Missing
- Community-powered product finding (vegan products near you)
- Hyper-local availability tracking
