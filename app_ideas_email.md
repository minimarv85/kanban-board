Hi James,

Here's the App Store Opportunities Research Report you asked for. I've analysed Reddit communities, X/Twitter pain points, and market trends to find profitable app ideas for 2026.

## KEY INSIGHTS

**Subscription Fatigue is Real**
People are tired of monthly subscriptions. They're happy to pay £2.99-£9.99 for a one-time purchase that solves their problem and works offline.

**Simplicity Wins**
A developer on Reddit removed features from their expense app (no bank syncing, no dashboards) and user retention doubled. Micro-apps with ONE job done perfectly beat complex feature-rich apps every time.

**UK Local Markets Are Wildly Underserved**
Millions of UK small businesses and tradespeople have no simple digital tools. This is a massive opportunity.
