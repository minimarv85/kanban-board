# TradeTax Changelog

## Automated Nightly Enhancements

### 2026-02-03 - Initial Setup
- Created automated enhancement cron job
- Configured feature rotation system
- Set up logging and changelog

---

## How It Works

Every night at 23:00, the system will:
1. Pull latest code from GitHub
2. Audit buttons and interactive elements
3. Build one new feature from the backlog
4. Test changes
5. Commit and push to GitHub
6. Update this changelog

## Feature Rotation

Features are built on a rotating schedule:
- Monday: Quick Tax Estimator
- Tuesday: Export PDF Invoices  
- Wednesday: Auto-Categorize Expenses
- Thursday: Tax Deadline Reminders
- Friday: Profit Margin Calculator
- Saturday: Bulk Invoice Generator
- Sunday: Client Database

## Deployment

After each nightly enhancement:
1. GitHub auto-deploys to Vercel
2. Changes live at: https://tradetax.pages.dev
