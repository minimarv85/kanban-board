Claude Code dropping autonomous coding agents. The workflow shift is real. Build faster, debug smarter. ⚡ #AI #Coding

DeepSeek proving you don't need $10B to compete. Efficient models > bloated models. Cost per token matters. 💰

OpenAI's Pro tier at $200/mo signals where this is going: enterprise AI > consumer AI. Business value wins. 📈

The real AI winners in 2025: not the models. The integrations. The workflows. The stuff that actually ships. 🚀

Monday mood: AI tools that actually ship > endless theory. Build more, theorize less. 🚀

Just checked what Claude Code can do now. These autonomous agents are moving FAST. 2025 gonna be wild. 🔥

The boring AI stuff is winning. Not the flashiest. Not the most hyped. Just the stuff that works. 💡

Hot take: OpenAI might not be the winner long-term. Niche > generalist when the generalist gets commoditized. 🎯

Week in review: AI progress is actually INSANE when you stop doomscrolling. Small models getting big capabilities. 📈

The future isn't about more features. It's about smarter defaults. The tools that win will be the ones that get out of your way. ⚡

Sometimes the best productivity hack is using fewer tools. Quality over quantity. Your stack doesn't need to be complicated. 📦

AI isn't replacing anyone. It's people using AI replacing people who don't. The gap is widening fast. Stay curious. 🚀
