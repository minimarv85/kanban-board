Mozilla just did something rare in tech: they listened.

Users were unhappy about AI being shoved into Firefox. So Mozilla's CEO promised a "kill switch." 

Now it's happening. Feb 24th update adds an AI control menu. Use it or don't. Your choice.

This is how you build trust in the AI era. Not by forcing features down throats. 👏

Something's shifting. Countries are quietly building alternatives to US tech.

France banned officials from using American tech. The ICC dumped Microsoft after that "kill email" incident. 1 million people joined UpScrolled after TikTok concerns.

Proton Mail now has 100M+ users. Europeans pushing Tomtom over Google Maps.

The internet isn't as US-dominated as it used to be. 🌍

Here's what's wild about 2026 so far:

Every major browser is racing to shove AI down your throat. Except one just added a way to turn it ALL off.

Browsers with "AI features" are the norm now. But users want choice. And Mozilla gets it.

If your browser doesn't give you control, maybe it's time to ask why. 🤔
